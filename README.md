When learning the **Axios** HTTP Client, I created a random activity generator to make HTTP requests to the 'Bored API' (https://bored-api.appbrewery.com/)

When the user opens the generator for the first time, a GET requests presents them with a random activity they could consider doing.

From there, the user can filter the type of activity they'd like to be recommended, and a POST request will return one that fits the criteria if it exists in the Bored API.

**EJS** was used as the template engine to render data processed by the **ExpressJS** server
